            To help fund these experiences, we offer club memberships. While many events are open to everyone, some require an admission  
            fee for non-members. By becoming a member, you gain free access to all paid events, making it a cost-effective way to participate  
            while supporting the club. Additionally, members have the option to purchase an exclusive  
            <b>Japanese Culture Society T-shirt</b> with their membership.
