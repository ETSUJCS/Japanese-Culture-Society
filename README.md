Welcome to the Web Master role for the Culture Society. In order to do this task, you will need some starting information. 

To make edits to the webpage, you will want to go to the index.html file and then in the right, select edit, afterwards, select Commit Changes and put a description of what was done. According to ETSU these requirements must remain for the website to be posted on the Lit Lang page "We do not see an issue as long as the site is monitored for any inappropriate content and we ask that they keep accessibility in mind with their club website - add alt text to images, check color contrast for text and the colored background, and use headings." 

1. To maintain the images, it would be best to keep the images saved under the same file name in the images folder. If you would like to add more try to keep a similar naming structure and keep the file types as .jpg. If it is not a .jpg, open the image in a photos app, and select save a copy and change file type to .jpg.
2. When making events, be prepared to have things that get cancelled or altered in some way, just go through and double check to make sure that everything is still correct.
3. Comments in html are done by <!-- and ended with --> and in Java Script is /* */.
4. Some of the information will need to be updated every fall semester when it is time to buy T-Shirts. You might want to keep a note on their if you cannot get an example image of the shirts.
5. When making changes on Github, it will sometimes take 15 minutes for those changes to be visible, be patient and aware incase there are any mistakes.
6. You can add new information between the p tags on the index page
7. If you need to edit the style of the page at all, that is done in the css folder, however be careful as that can change more than what was intended.
8. If there is no new JOI coordinator, you can delete or comment out that section of Key Figures using the comments.
9. Images must have an alt field for page readers, look at other images posted.
10. If you decide on changing the colors for the webpage, check contrast through an online checker entering text color and the background color. This can be changed in the css folder.
